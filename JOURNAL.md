## 10/19/2025 - An introduction...   

I started this chapter of this project 3 weeks ago, under the impression that I didn't have to journal this in the hackclub blueprint. In the past 3 weeks, I have designed a routing patterns for an electromagnet coil in Fusion360, exported this as a DXF file, where I imported it into EasyEDA to route as copper coils. In addition I design and configured a schematic that included the power source (a solar voltaic cell), connected to a screw terminal, connected to a diode (to pervent current backflow), and a capacitor to ensure that the current is stable. This all conects to the PCB coil, creating the electromagnet.

## 11/3/2025 - Learning from regret.

Good evening- or what ever time of day it is for you... 
I haven't posted in a while as I have been busy with school, and my other projects. 

For the past 2 weeks I have been working on the topology of the rotor coils for the motor, trying to create a DXF file using the sketch feature on Fusion360. This is a tedious task, it took me hours and hours to create a single coil, and with this program ending in a few weeks I don't plan on wasting any more time. I regret wasting all this time- but I think I have found a solution.  

I am looking into generating the topologies with a python script, perhaps using the python turtle library. If you have experience doing this, let me know! 

I worked for about an hour and a half today, however my timer says otherwise as I had to pause it to talk to my mom and I frogot to unpause it afterwards. 


If you're interested in what I do, I try and post a vlog every other week: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVQ7SidtTqw
