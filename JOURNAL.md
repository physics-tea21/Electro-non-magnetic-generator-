## 10/19/2025 - An introduction...   

I started this chapter of this project 3 weeks ago, under the impression that I didn't have to journal this in the hackclub blueprint. In the past 3 weeks, I have designed a routing patterns for an electromagnet coil in Fusion360, exported this as a DXF file, where I imported it into EasyEDA to route as copper coils. In addition I design and configured a schematic that included the power source (a solar voltaic cell), connected to a screw terminal, connected to a diode (to pervent current backflow), and a capacitor to ensure that the current is stable. This all conects to the PCB coil, creating the electromagnet.
